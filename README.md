## About this project

This repo is a sandbox for experimenting with Web JS optimizations and implementations for the [OpenTelemetry JS](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js) project.

Any and ALL code in this repository __SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR PRODUCTION__ as it is subject to change (over time) and will not be supported for production purposes. Any improvements identified by this sandbox will be either merged back to the official release repositories or if necessary new repo(s) may be created.

> There will be __NO__ Production level support for any code from this repository, if you are helping and experimenting with the SDK generated by this repo please feel free to create issues.

## Official Repositories

For production level support please use these repositories

- [OpenTelemetry Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification)
- [~~OpenTelemetry JS API~~](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-api) Now merged back into [OpenTelemetry JS](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js)
- [OpenTelemetry JS](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js)
- [OpenTelemetry JS Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib)

## Sandbox Goals

- Investigate creation of the Web-JS optimized Sdk (excluding generic node support, which is already supported by the [official JS respository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js) )

## Current State / Support

- Non-functional!

## Branches

- [main](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-sandbox-web-js) Used to merge code from the `auto-merge/repo-staging` into a form that can be built while still containing the history and tags from the official repository's. This branch will also be updated periodically to merge the changes from the `auto-merge/repo-staging` so that working branches can consume changes from the original source repositories by rebasing to this branch.
- [auto-merge/repo-staging] Used as a staging branch to merge the `main` branch from the original source [OpenTelemetry JS](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js);  [OpenTelemetry JS API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-api) repositories so that all commit history and tags are included in this repository. To avoid / reduce merge issues, as part of the [auto-merge script](./sandbox-tools/merge-repos/) it will ALWAYS select the source repository's version, this branch does not have any compile targets or validation. This branch will be updated periodically to continuously merge changes from the original master source repos into this repository.
- `minification` (TBD) - used to experiment with different levels of minification.
- `release` (TBD) Only if needed to publish packages for 3rd party testing.
- [auto-instrumentation-poc](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-sandbox-web-js/tree/auto-instrumentation-poc) This branch is used to prototype new instrumentations that generate events (as log records). 

## Automated merge workflows

These scripts are designed to be run periodically to enable the continous merging of changes from the official repositories so that we don't end up creating and identifying changes that cannot be easily contributed back to the official repositories.

- [Auto Merge] Merge official OTel JS repos to merge-staging
  - Used to merge all changes from the official repositories and their history into the `auto-merge/repo-staging` branch. This creates a PR to perform the merge and only 1 PR may exist at any point in time (running the workflow while a PR already exists will fail)
- (TBD) [Auto Merge] Merge staging branch to main
  - This script (not in this initial PR) will be used to merge the files from the `repo-staging` branch into a structure that can be used and built. This will relocate the individual packages into a simplier stucture which will use `rush` and `rollup` to build and generate web bundles. And will also include web specific tests for all supported (merged) packages.

## Contributing

When merging from the core repo's to [main](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-sandbox-web-js) please use the automated script `npm run merge-repos`, this requires that you have cloned the source repos locally and assumes that they are located in the same root folder. See [merge-source.js](./scripts/merge-source.js)
