## About this project

This repo is a sandbox for experimenting with Web JS optimizations and implementations for the [OpenTelemetry JS](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js) project.

Any and ALL code in this repository __SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR PRODUCTION__ as it is subject to change (over time) and will not be supported for production purposes. Any improvements identified by this sandbox will be either merged back to the official release repositories or if necessary new repo(s) may be created.

> There will be __NO__ Production level support for any code from this repository, if you are helping and experimenting with the SDK generated by this repo please feel free to create issues.

## Official Repositories

For production level support please use these repositories

- [OpenTelemetry Specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification)
- [OpenTelemetry JS API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-api)
- [OpenTelemetry JS](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js)
- [OpenTelemetry JS Contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib)

## Sandbox Goals

- Investigate creation of the Web-JS optimized Sdk (excluding generic node support, which is already supported by the [official JS respository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js) )

## Current State / Sup

- Non-functional!

## Branches

- [main](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-sandbox-web-js) Used to merge code from the official repo into the sandbox using helper script to merge changes.
- `minification` (TBD) - used to experiment with different levels of minification.
- `release` (TBD) Only if needed to publish packages for 3rd party testing.

## Contributing

When merging from the core repo's to [main](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-sandbox-web-js) please use the automated script `npm run merge-repos`, this requires that you have cloned the source repos locally and assumes that they are located in the same root folder. See [merge-source.js](./scripts/merge-source.js)
